I've ignored the a.out files because they won't work (most likely) for your CPU Architecture.

This is the language I'm switching to from Rust. At least, until I've learned enough to create a linked list and/or something more complex without any other librarys/imports.

This will be structured the same as my Rust repo.

If you have any tips, please share them in a pull request!
